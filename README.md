## Reasoning behind this library
When working on client-side apps, which are either prototypes/POCs or are supposed to be thin clients, getting all the data from the server, the need for some random data to be used in code arise.
There's a great lib [Chance.js][2] and there's a great service [json-generator][3], which help greatly when in need of some random data for that matter, but you either need to know all the objects/properties you will need in advance, or you're going to use single object and call some methods on them.

**Aleph.js** can be considered a plain chance.js wrapper based on [ES6 Proxies][4], which gives you an opportunity to get random data by simply trying to access it in place, without need to call some methods or create new nested objects.

## How to use
### Installation for node.js
1. Install library by running 

        npm install sudodoki/Aleph.js

2. Require it in your code 

        var Store = require('Aleph.js')
        var store = new Store()

### Installation for browser
1. Install library by running

        bower install sudodoki/Aleph.js

2. Include bower_components/Aleph.js/bundled.js into your page.
You now have Aleph constructor globally available.

### Usage

After instantiating Aleph constructor you will get object that will have either properties from standard [API][7], like 'name', 'surname', 'bio', 'phone' or other nested Aleph objects (unless you assign something yourself). Thus, you can do something like

      var store = new Aleph();
      store.people
        .forEach(function(person){
          console.log(person.name + ' ' + person.surname);
        });

There's an [example][9] of using Aleph together with AngularJS to display simple contact book. Be sure to run in [compatible](#compatibility) browser.

## Compatibility
This library is impelemented using [proxies][4], so it will run in environments, [that have support for those][5]. Generally speaking, it's Node behind `--harmony` flag and FF. This library also leverages [harmony-reflect][6] for getting some normalized goodies across different environments.

## API
There's a [mapping][7] for property name in Aleph & which method would be called on [chance][2] library
## Todos
There're some sort of [roadmap][8] I would like to see implemented to consider this thing done & usable, would appreciate some feedback and/or contributions.
